# mern-skateboard-ecommerce
MERN stack e-commerce skateboard website

This is a project I did to test out my Front-end skills. 
I originally created the website with a static database.
I eventually wanted to implement backend using the MERN stack.

so Lots of the work in the backend was following alongside a tutorial.
Including most of the redux since that was a big learning curve in creating this App for scalability.
